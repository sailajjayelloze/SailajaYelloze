## 1. Executive Summary

The Prison Management System Modernization project—a $350M, five-year transformation—aims to unify seven legacy systems for 60,000–70,000 prisoners within a secure, AI-driven platform. Entering the final year, the project faces significant challenges: $20M budget overrun, frequent data errors, high latency, and underperforming AI models. This report delivers a thorough technical evaluation, actionable recovery strategies, and innovative solutions to restore client trust and project value.

---

## 2. Project Overview

### 2.1 Scope

- Consolidate seven disparate legacy prison management systems into a unified, cloud-native solution.
- Serve 60,000–70,000 prisoners across at least seven major facilities.
- Integrate operations, data, and AI-driven decision support for prisoner assignment, security, and staffing.

### 2.2 Goals

- Enhance operational efficiency, accuracy, and security.
- Reduce manual efforts and costs using AI for inmate recommendations, anomaly detection, and staffing predictions.
- Deliver real-time, reliable prisoner and facility data for informed decision-making.

### 2.3 Current Challenges

> **Note:**  
> These challenges must be addressed urgently to restore system reliability, improve operational outcomes, and rebuild client trust.

### 2.4 Current System Architecture (Brief)

The Prison Management System uses a modern, cloud-based architecture with these key components:

- **Front-end:** Built on Pega, providing the user interface for prison operations, data entry, and reporting.
- **Back-end:** Hosted on AWS Cloud (EC2, S3), responsible for compute, storage, and running AI models.
- **Database:** Uses AWS RDS (PostgreSQL) as the main relational database for managing all prisoner, facility, and operations data. (Legacy data was migrated from an Oracle Data-Mart.)
- **AI Components:**
    - **Inmate Recommender:** Built with AWS SageMaker, suggests optimal facility assignments.
    - **Security Monitoring:** Custom AI model for anomaly detection and compliance tracking.
    - **Staffing Predictions:** AWS Lambda-based models predict weekly staffing needs.

*This architecture is designed to integrate and modernize seven legacy systems into one unified solution.*

### 2.5 Defects / Weaknesses in Current System Architecture

- **Data Quality and Synchronization Issues:** Migration from Oracle to PostgreSQL led to SQL incompatibilities and schema mismatches. Facility and policy updates are not reliably synced, causing AI systems to work on outdated or incorrect data.
- **Query Performance & Inconsistency:** Poorly optimized SQL queries (originally designed for Oracle) cause slow performance and inconsistent/inaccurate prisoner records.
- **High System Latency:** Significant delays (up to 12 hours) in updating prisoner status and judicial updates, making real-time operations unreliable.
- **Over-Engineering and Complexity:** The system is built for a much larger scale than required, increasing cost and reducing usability for staff.
- **AI Underperformance:** AI models are slow (high latency), inaccurate, and not retrained often enough due to poor data pipelines and lack of operational feedback.
- **Reduced Oversight and Quality Control:** Budget cuts have reduced QC and data engineering staff, leading to less testing, more undetected errors, and security vulnerabilities.
- **AWS Resource Inefficiency:** Overuse of expensive resources (like GPUs for non-AI tasks) has led to unnecessary cloud spending and budget overruns.
- **Security Vulnerabilities:** Fewer cloud security specialists mean less monitoring and more unaddressed compliance risks.

### 2.6 Staffing Breakdown

**Original Team (Years 1–3):**  
- Team Size: 42 members  
- Key Roles: Project Managers, AI Architects, Data Engineers, DevOps, Front-end/Back-end Developers, QC Analysts, Data Scientists, Business Analysts, Cloud Security, Solution Architects.

**Staffing Cuts (Years 4–5, due to budget overrun):**  
- Major reductions in QC Analysts, Data Engineers, Cloud Security Specialists, Front-End Devs, Business Analysts, DevOps Engineers.
- **Result:** Less system testing, more data errors, reduced optimization, increased security vulnerabilities, slower feature development, and AWS inefficiencies.

### 2.7 Main Problems Identified

- **Reduced Testing and Oversight:** Fewer QC staff led to more undetected errors and data inconsistencies.
- **Poor SQL Query Optimization:** Data engineers cut, causing performance issues and incorrect/incomplete data integration.
- **Security Risks:** Fewer cloud security staff resulted in less monitoring and more vulnerabilities.
- **Development Delays:** Slower front-end and AI feature delivery due to fewer developers.
- **Misalignment with User Needs:** Reduced business analysts led to features not aligned with real operational priorities.
- **Infrastructure Inefficiency:** DevOps cuts led to higher AWS latency and inefficiency.
- **Overall Impact:** System performance and AI accuracy below targets, increased operational risk, and user dissatisfaction.

### 2.8 Prisons and Prisoners

- **Number of Prisoners:** The system manages between 60,000 and 70,000 prisoners at any given time.
- **System Scale:** Manages less than 500,000 total records.
- **Number of Prisons:** At least seven major prison facilities (one for each legacy system), possibly more due to sub-facilities.

### 2.9 Performance Snapshot (from the Report)

- **Recommender System Accuracy:** 65% (Target: 85%)
- **Processing Time per Recommendation:** 7 seconds (Target: 3 seconds)

    - *Impact:* Slow adoption, more support needed, low operational value.

#### 3.1.2 Identification of Project Shortcomings

*(See above table in Section 2.7)*

#### 3.1.3 Client Feedback Considerations & Recommendations

- **Customer Feedback Considerations:**
    - Inconsistent and inaccurate prisoner records cause confusion and operational disruption.
    - System latency results in unacceptable delays for judicial updates and prisoner releases, leading to real-world risk.
    - AI models are not trusted due to frequent errors and slow, non-actionable recommendations; staff often revert to manual processes.
    - Over-complexity and features irrelevant to actual needs reduce staff adoption and satisfaction.
    - Security alerts are too slow, missing critical incidents.
    - The project’s cost overruns and inefficiencies have eroded client trust and raised concerns about future maintenance.

- **Recommendations:**
    - Prioritize data quality: Immediate focus on query optimization, validation, and migration reconciliation.
    - Reduce system latency: Shift to event-driven updates for critical operations.
    - Simplify AI models and workflows: Tailor features to actual user needs; provide transparency and staff feedback loops.
    - Restore client trust: Hold regular stakeholder meetings, deliver visible improvements early, and share transparent KPIs.
    - Bolster security monitoring: Reallocate resources to real-time alerting and compliance checks.

### 3.2 Feasibility of Recovery Plan

#### 3.2.1 Data Quality & Query Optimization

- **Recovery Actions:**
    - Reinstate 2–3 QC/Data Engineers: Focused on SQL correction, schema harmonization, and automated data validation.
    - Rework SQL for PostgreSQL: Use native functions, proper indexing, and normalization. Implement automated scripts for data consistency checks.
    - Set up Data Quality Dashboards: Real-time monitoring of data integrity and query performance.

##### 3.2.1.1 Query Optimization: Practical Examples

```sql
-- Example 1: Replace Oracle NVL with PostgreSQL COALESCE
-- Before (Oracle)
SELECT prisoner_id, NVL(medical_status, 'Unknown') FROM prisoners;

-- After (PostgreSQL)
SELECT prisoner_id, COALESCE(medical_status, 'Unknown') FROM prisoners;

-- Example 2: Optimize Joins with Proper Indexing
-- Before (slow, no index)
SELECT p.prisoner_id, f.facility_name
FROM prisoners p
JOIN facilities f ON p.facility_id = f.facility_id
WHERE f.region = 'North';

-- Optimization Steps:
CREATE INDEX idx_facilities_region ON facilities(region);
CREATE INDEX idx_prisoners_facility_id ON prisoners(facility_id);

-- Use EXPLAIN to analyze and optimize further

-- After (faster join)
SELECT p.prisoner_id, f.facility_name
FROM prisoners p
JOIN facilities f ON p.facility_id = f.facility_id
WHERE f.region = 'North';

-- Example 3: Use Partial Index for Frequent Queries
CREATE INDEX idx_active_prisoners ON prisoners(status)
WHERE status = 'active';

-- Example 4: Batch vs. Real-Time Update
-- Before: Nightly batch update for status
UPDATE prisoners
SET release_status = 'released'
WHERE release_date <= NOW();

-- After: Event-driven trigger on judicial update
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_release_status()
RETURNS trigger AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.release_date <= NOW() THEN
    UPDATE prisoners SET release_status = 'released' WHERE prisoner_id = NEW.prisoner_id;
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### 3.2.2 System Latency & Architectural Improvements

- Deploy In-Memory Caching (Redis) for hot data (e.g., prisoner status, judicial updates).
- Adopt Event-Driven Processing: Use AWS Lambda/SQS for immediate updates to critical records.
- Incremental Processing: Replace batch jobs with incremental triggers for high-priority fields.

#### 3.2.3 AI Model Enhancement

- Retrain Models: Use cleaned and recent data, focusing on operational feedback from the last year.
- Algorithm Selection: Swap deep learning models for faster, interpretable ML (e.g., XGBoost, decision trees) suitable for data volume.
- Establish Feedback Loop: Monthly staff input on model errors incorporated into retraining.

#### 3.2.4 Resource & Cost Controls

- AWS Cost Optimization:
    - Move non-AI workloads to CPUs/spot instances.
    - Monitor with AWS Cost Explorer.
    - Set and enforce cost alerts.
